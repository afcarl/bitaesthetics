### About Paul

I like making images, animations, and interactive tools out of data. I'm probably best known for my 2010 [visualization of Facebook friend connections](http://fbmap.bitaesthetics.com). I have a Bachelor of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo. I love sailing and live music and am currently based in New York City.

I'm [paulgb on GitHub](https://github.com/paulgb). You can contact me at [bit@paulbutler.org](mailto:bit@paulbutler.org). For more about me, see my [resume](http://resume.paulbutler.org) and [paulbutler.org](http://paulbutler.org/).
