About bitaesthetics
---

The ongoing evolution of web technology has opened up a range of opportunities for data visualization, from SVG to canvas to mobile APIs. Bitaesthetics is a personal project to build a series of high-quality open-source data visualizations, while generalizing common componenets into open-source packages. My goal is to push the state of the art of open-source visualization.

I like making images, animations, and interactive tools out of data. I'm best known for my 2010 [visualization of Facebook friend connections](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/12/data_visualisation_1). I have a Bachelor of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo. I love sailing and live music and am currently based in Toronto.
