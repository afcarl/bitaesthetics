The ongoing evolution of web technology has opened up a range of opportunities for data visualization, from SVG to canvas to mobile devices. Bitaesthetics is a personal project to build a series of high-quality open-source data visualizations, while turning reusable components into open-source packages. My goal is to push the state of the art of open-source visualization.

### About Paul

<img src="/images/sailing_small.jpg" alt="Paul sailing" style="float: right; padding: 1px; margin-left: 10px; border: 1px solid #555;" />

I like making images, animations, and interactive tools out of data. I'm probably best known for my 2010 [visualization of Facebook friend connections](http://fbmap.bitaesthetics.com). I have a Bachelor of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo. I love sailing and live music and am currently based in Toronto.

I'm [paulgb on GitHub](https://github.com/paulgb). You can contact me at [bit@paulbutler.org](mailto:bit@paulbutler.org). For more about me, see [paulbutler.org](http://paulbutler.org/).
